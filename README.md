# trdm-lambda
Provides a serverless Java application to host an internal RESTful interface. This Java application will handle SOAP-based requests toward TRDM on behalf of our Go MilMove server. It will be hosted as an AWS Lambda function for MilMove API requests to TRDM via SOAP.

## Pre-Requisites

The first step is to download and install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and then [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html).

Letâ€™s run AWS SAM CLI on the path where the template.yaml is located and execute the command:
### Build

To build the application ru `sam build` from the root directory or in the same directory as the `template.yml` file.

### Run Application Locally

To run the application locally run `sam local start-api`

### Deploy

To deploy the application to AWS use `sam deploy`. Add the `--guided` flag to go through a guided deploy.


## ENV variables

The `application.yml` can store configurations for your env variables. Which includes both secrets and configs.

To add a new variable simply add it to the `application.yml` following the yaml syntax. Then create a new Java class under the `config` pacakge. `TrdmProps.java` is a good example to follow.

If there is a prefix for the config, make sure to add it. Then add all the properties related to the config in this file.

Java will read `my-prop` as `myProp` by default so if you use `-` just follow camel case standards when naming your variables in Java.
